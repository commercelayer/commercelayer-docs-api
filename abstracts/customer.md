Customers must contain an email address and, optionally, a password.
Registered customers can get an access token through the Password Flow to manage their data.
Customer status can be one of "prospect," (with no orders) "acquired," (with one order) or "repeat" (with two or more orders).
Associate a customer to a customer group if you want to assign a dedicated price list to that customer ([learn more](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/customer_groups)).
