A gift card is a special type of payment intrument that can be either purchased or used to pay for an order — in total or in part — depending on its outstanding balance. All gift cards must be activated before being used. Rechargeable gift cards can be reloaded at any time. Single use gift cards become redeemed after the first usage, whatever the balance used. Associate a gift card to a market if you want to restrict its avaibality to that specific market.
