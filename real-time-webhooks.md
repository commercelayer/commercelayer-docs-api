# Real-time webhooks

Commerce Layer provides a [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) mechanism to react to specific events in real-time. 

Each time a subscribed event occurs, we trigger a `POST` request to the endpoint that you specified in the `callback_url` field. The request contains a JSON payload in the same format that you get when fetching the same resource through the REST API. 

{% page-ref page="fetching-resources.md" %}

For each resource, you can also configure the related resources that should be included in the request body. The relationships will be set as the resource `include` query parameter.

{% page-ref page="including-associations.md" %}

When you create a new webhook, a **shared secret** is generated. It will be used each time the webhook is fired to sign the payload. The related signature will be stored in the **X-CommerceLayer-Signature** header so that you can verify the callback authenticity and consider it reliable.

### Responding to webhook callbacks

The endpoint listening for webhooks has **5 seconds** to respond with a **`2xx`** \(usually `200` \) response code,  acknowledging a successful delivery. If the request times out or gets a response with a status code other than `2xx`, it is considered failed.

### Handling webhook failures

If a webhook fails \(whatever the reason\) Commerce Layer tries to fire it again up to **10 times**. After **30 consecutive failures** \(retry failures included\) no further calls to the related endpoint are made and the webhook has to be reset.

{% hint style="info" %}
To let you properly handle this scenario and inspect the reasons for the failure,  after **5** consecutive non-successful attempts a communication is sent to the owner of the organization.
{% endhint %}
