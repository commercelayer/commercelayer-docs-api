description: How to fetch a collection of shipments via API
---

# List all shipments

To fetch a collection of shipments, send a `GET` request to the `/api/shipments` endpoint.

{% page-ref page="../../fetching-resources.md" %}

## Request

**GET** https://<i></i>yourdomain.commercelayer.io**/api/shipments**

### **Example**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
The following request fetches a collection of shipments:

```javascript
curl -X GET \
  https://yourdomain.commercelayer.io/api/shipments/ \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-access-token'
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
On success, the API responds with a `200 OK` status code, returning a paginated collection of resource objects:
